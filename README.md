This program is a simple console-based Bank Account Management System written in C. It allows users to perform various operations related to managing bank accounts, including registration, listing, deposit, withdrawal, searching, deletion, and displaying the bank's status. Here's a brief description of the program's key features:

Account Registration: Users can register a new bank account by providing details such as name, surname, national ID, address, account type, and initial balance. An account number is generated for each new account.

Listing Accounts: The program can list all the registered accounts, displaying their account numbers, account types, balances, names, surnames, national IDs, and addresses.

Deposit: Users can deposit a specified amount into their accounts by searching for the account using various criteria, such as account number, name, surname, address, or national ID.

Withdrawal: Similar to deposit, users can withdraw money from their accounts while specifying the target account based on different search criteria.

Searching Account: Users can search for accounts based on specific criteria like account number, name, surname, address, or national ID.

Deletion: Accounts can be deleted by specifying the index of the account to be removed. This is useful for closing accounts.

Displaying Bank Status: The program provides a summary of the bank's status, showing the total number of registered accounts and the total sum of money held in all accounts.

Data Persistence: Account data is saved to a text file (bank_data.txt) when the program is closed and loaded from the file when the program is launched, allowing data to be retained between sessions.

The program's user interface is text-based, and users can interact with it by entering numeric options based on the menu provided. The program offers basic account management functionality for a bank, making it suitable for educational purposes and simple account tracking.
